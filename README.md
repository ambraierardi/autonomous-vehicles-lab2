# Second lab of Autonomous Vehicles
After creating an ox map of the interested area in the environment, choosing an arbitrary origin and destination for the autonomous vehicle, it has been found the shortest path between the two points, drawn a graph exploiting the nodes and edges of the network and computed the lowest score given by the A* algorithm, both with and without obstacles on the map.
